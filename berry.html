    A paragraph is a big distinct, self-contained unit of writing comprising one or more sentences, typically focused on developing a single idea or topic. It serves as a structural, coherent component of larger text, usually featuring a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. Paragraphs improve readability by organizing, dividing, and clarifying, often indicated by indents or line breaks.
